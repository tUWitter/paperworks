## Project Idea Brainstorming
1. Anoymous Twitter(Reddit) clone UW 3 (complexity: ML, spam(user authentication (zero-knowledge proof)), censoring, mutilple accounts control,) 
2. Online store for 2nd-hand stuff (UW Kjiji) 2
3. Amazon Clone (Buyer, seller)

## Project Abstract
* Opportunity: development skills
* Problem: information about student life is scattered. Student voice are not recognized. Student wants to generate their content. Bridge the gap (reddit).
* Objective: Provide a inclusive and expressive space for students to shot ideas. 
* Plausible Design Approach: 
* Expected Benefits over Existing Alternatives: safety (censoring), specific for UW, better mobile UI reddit
* Summary of Results

### Project Abstract Draft (Ask for Revising)
The information relevant to campus life received by a UW student consists of emails from UW offices (for example, Student Success Office and Writing Center) and social media from student organizations (for example, GSA and WUSA). Institutions rather than individuals generate such information. With more personal voices, It is easier to build and change the community.  

The main obstacle to having more voices heard is peer pressure: young people tend to hide their ideas in exchange for acceptance from the group.

We want to help UW students to share their opinions with the community. We believe anonymity can solve the peer pressure problem. We want to build an anonymous web application that resembles Twitter. There is a single timeline of anonymous posts for whole UW community. Compared to other social platforms for the general user group, such as Instagram, this web application gather UW information in one place and thus saves students' time. Compared to Reddit, Which also provides anonymity, this web application provide better mobile user experience. 

The final web app should provide a safe space for UW students to speak out. It will not tolerate hate speech and violent content.
