B. Establish Team Meeting Norms/Expectations:
Day, time, place and frequency for regular team meetings: We will keep our meeting timings by discussing with all team members and we would make sure that we have at least one meeting every week to discuss and test the progress. In addition to that, all our meetings would be online, some might be in hybrid mode.
Punctuality and participation at team meetings: We would rotate the roles of leadership in every sprint and that team member would be responsible for making the agenda and would set up a meeting for the same.
Method for setting and following meeting agenda and note taking: The team leader for that particular sprint would be responsible for the meeting agenda and assigning the tasks to the SCRUM board. He/she would also be responsible for taking short notes regarding all the discussions and decisions if any.
Procedures in the absence of a team member: Firstly, we would make sure to come up with a meeting time that is favorable to each and every team member. In any circumstances, a team member is not able to catch up the meeting the team leader for that sprint would be responsible for updating the absent team member. And all the meeting minutes would be shared via email by the team leader.

C. Discuss Team and Individual Expectations:
     What are the teamâ€™s expectations
The desired goal of the project: We aim to build an anonymous web application that helps UW students across campus to engage with each other anonymously. In addition to that, we ensure to follow the best software agile practices and all the methodologies throughout our project.
Expectations for completing assignments and meeting deadlines: In terms of study habits, we are a group of consistent and organized students. We try to start assignments early and set specific milestones to ensure that we stay on track. We also like to make detailed outlines and to-do lists to stay organized. In terms of teamwork, we have had several positive experiences in the past. We are strong communicators, and good listeners and enjoy working with others to achieve a common goal. I am also a good listener and am open to feedback and suggestions. We believe that open communication is key to a successful team project. Overall, as a team, we plan to start assignments early and have consistent milestones, but we are also open to discussing and adjusting the schedule to ensure that all team members have enough time to complete the assignment to the best of their abilities. We believe that by considering the strengths and weaknesses of each team member and working together, we can achieve the best results for our project.


D. Managing Team Challenges & Conflict

As a team, we are aware of how critical it is to get constructive criticism in order to raise our performance. Whether it comes from routine check-ins or the conclusion of a project, we want to get feedback that is quick and precise. We like feedback that is offered in a private context and that is targeted at certain acts or habits.
In the event of a disagreement, we shall first talk to the other team member in question. We think that the key to reaching a settlement is having a frank and open dialogue. We will have a follow-up chat with another team member or a third party if a solution cannot be found. Involving the professor, in our opinion, should only be done as a last resort because we want to settle disputes within the team first.
The team will first speak with the member who has fallen short of an expectation or job to understand why, and if required, to give support and assistance in overcoming the difficulty. With the intention of coming up with a solution that benefits everyone, we shall act with respect and understanding. To ensure that the assignment is finished and the team is in sync, the team leader or a selected member will speak with the person and ensure follow-up.
In general, as a team, we value open communication and cooperation. We are aware that everyone has various skills and weaknesses, and we will cooperate to find solutions to any problems that may develop.

In case of infractions: We understand that infractions with a teammate can have a negative impact on the overall success of the project. Therefore, we will adopt repercussions to address the issue if transgressions persist after first addressing and support.
The repercussions will depend on how serious the violation was and how it affected the project. In some instances, if the offenses are small, we could provide the person with extra assistance and direction to help them get over their obstacles. We might need to reassign their portion of the project to another team member if the violations are more serious.
For grades, we recognize that final decision-making rests with the Professor. However, if infractions persist, we think it is only fair to penalize the individual with a lower mark for their lack of involvement or effort. This, in our opinion, is a just and impartial technique to make sure that everyone is held responsible for their part in the project.
